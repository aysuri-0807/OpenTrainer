# OpenTrainer
A Torchvision project which will eventually allow users to upload their own dataset and have it be trained through our scripts; without writing code themselves.

Version 1 Projection:
Users can choose from a limited range of datasets; train and deploy without having to write code themselves

Version 2 Projection: 
Include a larger range of datasets

Version 3 Projection:
Start custom dataset implementation
